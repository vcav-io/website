      <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Delegation changes power.
      </p>
      <p>
        When people act directly, their discretion is personal, contextual, and
        deniable — shaped by judgment in the moment. When agents act for them,
        discretion must be mechanical. It has to be built in, not assumed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Human discretion is inconsistent by design.
        Agent discretion must be consistent by construction.
      </p>
      <p>
        If agent ecosystems are going to mediate real human stakes — relationships,
        contracts, employment, governance — we need structural guarantees about what
        can and cannot be revealed.
      </p>
      <p>
        AgentVault defines a coordination layer for delegated AI — analogous to TLS
        for web traffic, but for bounded reasoning exchange.
