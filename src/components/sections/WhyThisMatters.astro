    <h2>Why This Matters</h2>

      <p>
        AI agents increasingly act as delegates for humans and organisations — negotiating,
        evaluating, and making recommendations on consequential problems. The infrastructure
        supporting this coordination has not kept pace. Current approaches are either shallow
        (public APIs and tool calls, no confidentiality over what is disclosed) or opaque
        (black-box intermediaries where the delegating parties have no verifiable record of
        what the model was shown, what rules were applied, or what output was returned).
        Neither model is adequate when the problem is sensitive and the stakes are real.
      </p>

        Existing protocols address adjacent problems. A2A (Google) and MCP focus on
        connectivity and tool access — how agents invoke capabilities — not on
        information-flow constraints or output verifiability. FIDES and AgentCrypt address
        trust establishment and encryption, but do not provide bounded output signals with
        mechanical schema enforcement. AgentVault addresses the gap directly: a protocol
        for bounded disclosure with a provenance receipt that proves exactly what
        contract was followed, what model profile was used, and what signal was produced.
        Applications include dispute resolution, procurement, hiring, medical triage, and
        civic coordination — any domain where agents must coordinate on sensitive inputs
        and the record of that coordination matters.
