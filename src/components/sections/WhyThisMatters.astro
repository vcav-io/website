    <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        AI agents increasingly act as delegates on <strong>consequential problems</strong> —
        negotiating, evaluating, recommending. Current coordination is either
        <strong>shallow</strong> (public APIs, no confidentiality) or <strong>opaque</strong>
        (black-box intermediaries, no verifiable record). Neither is adequate when the
        problem is sensitive and the stakes are real.
      </p>
      <p>
        A2A and MCP address connectivity. FIDES and AgentCrypt address trust establishment.
        None provide <strong>bounded output signals with mechanical schema enforcement
        and cryptographic receipts</strong>. AgentVault addresses that gap directly.
        Applications: dispute resolution, procurement, hiring, medical triage,
        civic coordination — any domain where the record of coordination matters.
