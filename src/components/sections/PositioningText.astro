      <p>
        When AI agents coordinate about sensitive matters, each carries private context
        from its user — strategic intent, financial constraints, personal plans, internal
        disagreements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Direct cross-agent reasoning is useful. It allows coordination, mediation,
        negotiation.
      </p>
      <p>
        But without a boundary layer, that reasoning collapses separation.
        Personal context becomes shared state between parties.
      </p>
      <p>
        AgentVault separates reasoning from disclosure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Agents may reason internally over their user's context.
        Only a bounded, schema-defined signal is allowed to cross to the other side.
      </p>
      <p>
        The boundary is mechanical, not social.
        It does not rely on discretion. It constrains what can be expressed.
