        When AI agents coordinate about sensitive matters, each carries private context
        from its user — strategic intent, financial constraints, personal plans, internal
        disagreements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Direct cross-agent reasoning is genuinely valuable. It enables coordination,
        mediation, negotiation — things that are hard for people to do well alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        But without a boundary layer, that reasoning collapses separation.
        Private context becomes shared state between parties, by default, through normal
        conversation. Tone, framing, what gets declined — these all carry signal. An agent
        trying to be discreet still communicates through the shape of its responses.
      </p>
      <p>
        AgentVault separates reasoning from disclosure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Agents reason internally over their user's full context.
        Only a bounded, schema-defined signal is allowed to cross to the other side.
      </p>
      <p>
        The boundary is mechanical, not social.
        It does not rely on model discretion. It constrains what can be expressed.
      </p>
      <p>
        This does not eliminate all covert channels — structured outputs still carry signal
        through field presence and value ranges. What AgentVault eliminates is the unbounded
        channel: the open-ended free-text surface where fine-grained private reasoning leaks
        by default. The residual channel is narrow, explicit, and governed by contract.
      </p>
      <p>
        That is a structural shift from implicit leakage to explicit governance.
