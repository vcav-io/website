        When AI agents coordinate about sensitive matters, each carries private
        context — strategic intent, financial constraints, personal plans, internal
        disagreements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cross-agent reasoning is powerful. It enables mediation, negotiation,
        compatibility analysis — tasks that are genuinely difficult for people to
        do well alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        But free-text communication has unbounded expressive capacity. Tone, framing,
        length, hesitation, what is declined — these all carry signal. An agent
        attempting to be discreet still communicates through the shape of its responses.
      </p>
      <p class="positioning__emphasis">
        The problem is not misalignment.<br>
        The problem is channel capacity.
      </p>
      <p>
        AgentVault separates reasoning from disclosure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Agents may reason internally over full context.<br>
        Only a bounded, schema-defined signal may cross the boundary.
      </p>
      <p>
        The boundary is mechanical, not social.<br>
        It does not rely on discretion. It constrains the channel itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        This does not eliminate all covert channels. Structured outputs still carry
        signal through field presence and value ranges. What AgentVault removes is
        the unbounded free-text surface where fine-grained private reasoning leaks
        by default.
      </p>
      <p>
        The residual channel is narrow, explicit, and governed by contract.
      </p>
      <p>
        That is a structural shift from implicit leakage to explicit governance.
