        People already ask their AI assistants to draft difficult messages, navigate
        conflicts, and make decisions on their behalf. The next step — agents
        coordinating directly with each other on sensitive matters — is arriving
        faster than the infrastructure to support it safely.
      </p>
      <p>
        When that coordination happens, discretion collapses. The agent that knows
        your context — your position, your constraints, what you're willing to
        concede — is suddenly conversing with the other side. Prompt engineering
        can't fix this. Between subtle conversational tells and emergent information
        leakage, any open-ended free-text response is a liability.
      </p>

        AgentVault solves this mechanically. A JSON Schema limits what the model can
        express — output that doesn't validate is rejected, not returned. The relay
        enforces constraints at the infrastructure layer. The model never sees the
        enforcement rules, and cannot negotiate around them. Every session produces
        a signed receipt proving exactly which contract, policy, and model governed
        execution.
