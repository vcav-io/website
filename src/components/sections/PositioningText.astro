        Agent coordination today is either shallow — public APIs, no confidentiality — or
        opaque, routed through black-box intermediaries with no verifiable record of what
        was disclosed. Neither model supports agents acting as trusted delegates on sensitive
        problems.

      <p>
        What has been missing is a protocol for bounded disclosure: a mechanism by which
        two agents can exchange a constrained, schema-validated signal under a jointly
        consented contract, producing a receipt that proves exactly what occurred.
        The Vault Family introduces that primitive.
